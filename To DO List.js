The user signs into their own personal dashboard.

The user can instantly see the following:

Carousel - Most popular newsletters.
Carousel - Most recent newsletters.

Under each newsletter will be a "Recieve this" button. Once the user clicks "Recieve this" on the newsletter, they will receive a 
confirmation email that theyve been subscribed to that newsletter.

By defaul they will receive emails once a day from any given newsletter.

They will be able to view their account page, in which they can click 'Stop receiving', and they will 
stop receiving emails from any given newsletter that theyre subscribed to. OR they can change the frequency
of emails received from once a day, to "Every", "1" all the way up to "10" hrs. 

Each Newsletter will have a bunch of content associated with it. So the users will receive a random curation
of content from that newsletter.
